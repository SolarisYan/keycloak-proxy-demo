## What is a Keycloak Proxy?
Keycloak has an HTTP(S) proxy that you can put in front of web applications and services where it is not possible to install the Keycloak adapter. You can set up URL filters so that certain URLs are secured either by browser login and/or bearer token authentication. You can also define role constraints for URL patterns within your applications.

Keycloak Proxy is designed primarily for Keycloak, an OpenID Connect identity provider. But it also works with other OpenID Connect identity providers.
